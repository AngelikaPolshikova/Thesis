## Scripts I'm working on:
LSTM_baseline.ipynd - good predictions, uploaded photos to the same dir. 

CNN_baseline.ipynd - got good predictions, had same problem as LSTM but was fixed.

GNN_baseline.ipynd - doesnt predict, but it shouldnt; exist just for comparison

"GCRN-placeholder" - havent looked at it in a while
