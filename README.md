## Overview

This project investigates a range of deep learning architectures for modeling calcium signal propagation in osteocyte-like networks using high-resolution confocal microscopy videos. The work evaluates spatial, temporal, and hybrid modeling approaches including:

- CNN Baseline  
- LSTM Baseline  
- GNN Baseline  
- ConvLSTM Hybrid Model  
- GCRN (Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network)  
- Transformer-based VQ-VAE (VideoGPT-style exploratory model)

All models are trained and evaluated using a rare in vitro dataset from the Soman Lab, consisting of spontaneous and chemically stimulated calcium activity recordings.
